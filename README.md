# rsync-homedir-excludes

## Usage:

```shell
# download to `/var/tmp/ignorelist`
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rubo77/rsync-homedir-excludes/master/rsync-homedir-excludes.txt -O /var/tmp/ignorelist
# or copy to `/var/tmp/ignorelist`
cp ./rsync-homedir-excludes.txt /var/tmp/ignorelist

# edit the file /var/tmp/ignorelist to your needs
nano /var/tmp/ignorelist

# define a Backup directory, for example:
BACKUPDIR=/media/$USER/linuxbackup/home/$USER/
BACKUPDIR=/media/workspace/home/$USER/

# first append the “-n” parameter rsync will simulate the operation. you should use this before you start:
rsync -naP --exclude-from=/var/tmp/ignorelist $HOME/ $BACKUPDIR

# check for permission denied errors in your homedir:
rsync -naP --exclude-from=/var/tmp/ignorelist $HOME/ $BACKUPDIR | grep denied

# if it is all fine, start your backup with
rsync -aP --exclude-from=/var/tmp/ignorelist $HOME/ $BACKUPDIR
```

You can edit the ignorelist file before execution as it serves you well:

- At the start, there is a section with directories, probably not worth a backup. Uncomment those lines to exclude them as well.
- All lines starting with a `#` are being ignored.
- The syntax doesn't support comments at the end of a line yet.
